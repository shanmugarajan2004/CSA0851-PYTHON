# Program to find sum, average, minimum, and maximum of a list

# Input: asking user to enter numbers separated by spaces
numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Calculate sum
total_sum = sum(numbers)

# Calculate average
average = total_sum / len(numbers)

# Find minimum and maximum
minimum = min(numbers)
maximum = max(numbers)

# Output the results
print(f"Sum: {total_sum}")
print(f"Average: {average}")
print(f"Minimum: {minimum}")
print(f"Maximum: {maximum}")
